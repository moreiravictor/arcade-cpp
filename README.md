# arcade-cpp

arcade-cpp is a little ping pong game built with C++ and SFML (in honor of one of my dogs, Julhinho) in order to learn a little about basics of game development.

If you want to run it, you can compile it on any C++ IDE or simply open: "x64/Release/SFML_visual" if your system is x64 based.
